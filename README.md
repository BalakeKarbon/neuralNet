# neuralNet

A neural network I wrote in high school around 2016. It used an evolutionary algorithm 
to aid in parallel training of the neural network. It had a gui that trained it for 
character recognition and preformed well at the task, although it seems as the code I 
found and uploaded is uncomplete... If the finished code is found on an old HDD this 
will be updated.
